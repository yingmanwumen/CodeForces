# 2063A: Minimum Coprime

https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2063/A

- **coprime**: two integers $a$ and $b$ are coprime if they share only one positive common divisor.
- **coprime segment**: $[l, r]$ is called a coprime segment if $l$ and $r$ are coprime.
- $[l', r']$ is contained by $[l, r]$ if $l \le l' \le r' \leq r$
- **minimum coprime segment**: a comprime segment $[l, r]$ doesn't contain any other coprime segment not equal to itself.
- Find the number of minimum coprime segments in given $[1, r]$.
